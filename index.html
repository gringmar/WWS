            </div>
            <div class="col s12">
                Is there any correlation between the qualities prioritized for the children hard work and tolerance for other?
                </br>
                How is the development of religious faith as a quality for children in Japan over the years?

                <h4>Question 1</h4>
                <img src="img2.png">
            </div>
            <div class="col s12">After choosing the desired categories to be displayed, we filter the highest nodes in the hardworking chart, 
              this allows us to see that the countries which most strongly think that the necesary quality
              of a child is hard work also have strong beliefs of them also being tolerant to others
              but it still consists of the bottom half of all the countries which have a higher priority
              in tolerance.</div>

              <img src="img3.png">
              <div class="col s12">If we change the data to be the most recent, we can see a change in trend, since
                both qualities have a bigger correlation, meaning that more people prioritize the two qualities
                in children during the latest years.</div>

                <img src="img4.png">
              <div class="col s12">If we hover over we see that India is the country with the
                highest values on the two scales. We can also see that is a country that see a lot of qualities
                as very important for a child, with the lowest one being independence. From this we can grasp a bit
                of the statistics of India and we could conduct studies on why some of the numbers are lower, such as 
                the independece, and get a better understanding on their culture and views. This is also shared with 
                the lowest rating country in these two categories, Haiti. Which also shares a very low priority of
                independence on children.

                <h4>Question 2</h4>
                <img src="img5.png">
            </div>
            <div class="col s12">We want to see the development of religios faith as a quality in children over the years of
              a specific country, in this case we take Japan as an example, since it has data recorded data
              for every time period. We can see that Japan in 1995-1999 has prioritized very low the religious
              faith in their children, even if it is not the lowest country is does not go above the 10%.
            </div>

            <img src="img6.png">
            
            <div class="col s12">During the period of 2000-2004 the percentage of people that see religious faith as an important quality 
              ascends a bit over 6%.
            </div>

            
            <img src="img7.png">
            
            <div class="col s12">During 2005-2009 it descends again a bit, but it still around the 6%.
            </div>

            <img src="img8.png">
            
            <div class="col s12">Finally during 2010-2014 Japan stays within the same range for religious faith as the past years. We can conclude
              that Japan has not been a country over the last 20 years that prioritize the religious faith. This can makes
              us understand that it might be a country that is not very religious. From this it could be researched which religions
              in japan priorities this quality for their children and if the religions are more based on faith or just traditions.

          The learning outcomes from the project is not limited to the development behind it, e.g. become more used to using d3
          creating interactions, filters and formating everything in real time, but also in the potential of discovery through
          a visualization, with a simple brush function it is possible to highlight data and clearly see any correlation between
          different categories which may not be possible due to the clutter caused by the Data. Choosing what kind of visualization 
          was very tricky and the posible discoveries are not clear until the interaction with the visualization is done. The limitations
          due to the little experience with the technologies limited the possibility of creating something more advanced with better capabilities
          of visualizing the data for easier navigation.
